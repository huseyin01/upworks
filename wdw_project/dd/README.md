## Client's first message
We are an independent management consultancy lead by two retired executives from large regional companies. We focus on HR, workforce and personnel issues in our work with clients.

One of our client companies is interested in bringing analytics into hiring. The client currently employs human screeners to read through job applications and make hiring decisions for their workforce.

To improve selection, we'd like to use machine learning to predict each applicant's job performance using data from the candidateâ€™s application. We have some experience in this area, but do not have a full-time IT staff.

We'd like to hire you to implement a proof-of-concept algorithm to showcase the potential of this approach. This is the first step in a long-term project. If things work out, we'd be glad to keep working together to develop this implementation more for this client.

For now, we would like for you to build an algorithm that uses data to make predictions about 20,000 new (unlabeled) candidates and output these candidates into a CSV file. We will deliver a dataset you can use appropriately for development. We also have a few questions about your approach which we'll ask via a simple survey.

The data is already very well-cleaned and you should be able to begin modeling immediately. You may use the programming environment of your choice (R, Python, Java, whatever, including open-source libraries) and whatever statistical or machine learning approach you wish.

For your assistance with this task, you will be paid hourly (with a maximum of 5 hours total allowable), plus a bonus. The deliverables are: 1) a complete set of predictions in CSV output, 2) a code file and 3) a complete survey about a few questions we have (all completed in good faith). 


## Client's second message
We would like you to predict job performance (the variable job_performance). To clarify, we would like you to work five hours total (at $45 per hour). We understand this may result in only a preliminary set of results.

If you need a few weeks to develop your model, that's okay. However we need to use only five hours total. The data is relatively clean and you should be able to begin modeling immediately.
